- 👋 Hi, I’m Nadja and this is my github account @nadjascodejourney
- 🎨 I studied art, worked in an art and history museum and now I bring these worlds together with webdev because I see real opportunities in unusual connections
- 👀 I’m also really interested in webdesign, illustration, typography, diving, cats 🐈 and birds of prey 🦅
- 🌱 I’m currently learning user interface basics as part of my one-year webdev programme at [@digitalcareerinstitute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on artistic, playful and creative website projects
- 📫 How to reach me: PN or visit me on instagram: nadjaschwarzenegger
